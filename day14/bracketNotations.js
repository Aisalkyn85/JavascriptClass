/* Strings bracket Notations */















/* bracket notation is a way to get a
character that's at a specific index
within a string javascript doesn't start
counting at one like humans do
it starts at zero this is referred to as
zero based indexing here we've assigned
the first name variable to the string jump
so with this string you can get the
value of the first letter of the string */

var word = "Jump"
console.log(word[0])
console.log(word[1])
console.log(word[word.length-1])
